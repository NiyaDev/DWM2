# FUN_ROM31_5040()
Still don't know what this is for.
It writes either \$20 or \$10 and then \$30 over and over again.
As far as i've dug [$C47C] never is set to \$FF so it never goes from [$C47F], and none of the actual inputs are set to anything where [$C47C] & 7 would equal 0.
Maybe it's a time/cycle sink? But then why would it also have a Wait7000() inside of it and after almost every use...
## Code
```
FUN_ROM31_5040 :: proc() {
	if [$C524] == 0 do return;
	
	if [$C47C] == $FF do HL = $C47F;
	else {
		HL = ([$C47C] * 2) + $5094;
		HL = [HL];
	}
	
	A = [HL] & 7;
	if A == 0 do return;
	
	// Runs 1 -> 8 times
	B = A;
	for {
		{ BC
			[rP1] = 0;
			[rP1] = P1F_GET_NONE;
			
			// 
			for i:=16; i!=0; i-=1 {
				D   = [HL];
				HL += 1;
				for i:=8; i!=0; i-=1 {
					if bit(0, D) do [rP1] = P1F_GET_BTN;
					else         do [rP1] = P1F_GET_DPAD;
					
					[rP1] = P1F_GET_NONE;
					
					D  = D >> 1;
				}
			}
			
			[rP1] = P1F_GET_DPAD;
			[rP1] = P1F_GET_NONE;
		}
		B -= 1;
		if B == 0 do return;
		
		Wait7000();
	}
}
