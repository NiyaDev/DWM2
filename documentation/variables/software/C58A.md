So far, looks like a bool. It's state is only ever checked if 0 or !0.

- Checks if == 0 twice. The second time it sends execution back to main().
	- Inside FUN_03A4().
- Checks if != 0. If it isn't, it skips a majority of the function.
	- Inside FUN_14D1()
- If != 0, call FUN_14D1().
	- Inside FUN_077A()
- if == 0, call FUN_095B().
	- Inside main()
