So far, looks like a bool. It's state is only ever checked if 0 or !0.

- Checks if == 0 twice. The second time it sends execution back to main().
	- [FUN_03A4()](bank0/FUN_03A4.md)
- Checks if != 0. If it isn't, it skips a majority of the function.
	- [FUN_14D1()](bank0/FUN_14D1.md)
- If != 0, call FUN_14D1().
	- [FUN_077A()](bank0/FUN_077A.md)
- if == 0, call FUN_095B().
	- [main()](main.md)
- Set to 1 at multiple of the endings.
	- [FUN_ROM27_4001()](bank27/FUN_4001.md)
- If equal to 0, return without doing anything.
	- [FUN_048A()](bank0/FUN_048A.md)
